# 🧠 Python Repository — AI & Parallel and Distributed Computing

Welcome to this hands-on learning repository that bridges **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Parallel & Distributed Computing (PDC)** — designed to help you build **strong conceptual foundations** while exploring **real system-level implementations**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains two main learning tracks:

| Folder                                   | Focus                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧩 `AI/`                                 | Artificial Intelligence | Covers algorithms, logic, and reasoning — from beginner-friendly concepts to advanced implementations like search algorithms, learning models, and decision-making systems. |
| ⚙️ `Parallel_and_distributed_computing/` | Systems & OS Essentials | Focuses on how operating systems and distributed systems handle multitasking, process creation, synchronization, and performance optimization.                              |

Each section is structured **step-by-step** — with readable explanations, clear examples, and short conceptual notes that connect **theory to practice**.

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

This project is not just about copying code — it’s about **understanding why things work**.
Each topic aims to be:

* 🔹 **In-depth but not overwhelming** — focused on clarity, not complexity.
* 🔹 **Practical** — real code, real outputs, real understanding.
* 🔹 **Concept-driven** — builds intuition before diving into advanced systems.
* 🔹 **Progressive** — start from fundamentals and move toward advanced concepts.

## 💡 Philosophy in One Line

> *"Understand the concept deeply enough that code becomes the easiest part."*

---

## 🧩 Coming Soon

* 🔸 AI: Pathfinding, Minimax, and Machine Learning Basics
* 🔸 PDC: Process Management, Concurrency, Synchronization
